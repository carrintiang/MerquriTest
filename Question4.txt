QUESTION 4
A custom annotation can be designed to wrap the @PreAuthorize annotation at the class level, enabling centralized configuration. 
This will simplify future changes for security logic as I will only need to update the custom annotation instead of modifying @PreAuthorize individually across each method. 
This approach promotes cleaner and more efficient code management.
